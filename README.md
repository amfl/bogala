# d3js experiments

Testing out d3 and its suitability to create a board game description language

Could base it off sgf - http://dashstofsk.net/gorilla.html
http://dashstofsk.net/sgf.html Uses sgf to represent both go and hex boards, so
there's prior art for this.

- https://newbedev.com/how-to-use-d3-in-node-js-properly
- Could use [svg.js][svg] instead of d3js: https://github.com/svgdotjs/svgdom
    - Official, node-friendly version of example visualization lib from
      honeycomb docs

I'd like to end up with something like
